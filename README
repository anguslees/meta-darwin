OpenEmbedded meta layer for darwin based SDKs

Note: For now, only OSX SKDs up until 10.10 are supported. Later SDKs require
Apples TAPI library to be present. This will be added to the layer at a later
point.

You also need a OS-X sysroot tarball/zip file generated (copied) from a target OS-X
system. This is placed in the osx-runtime files directory and is used to compile the SDK
against it. It needs to contain the system libraries (/usr/lib) and include files 
(/usr/include). This tarball is not part of this meta-darwin layer and must be
created by the user. To create it, the user is required to have a legitimate Mac computer
with OSX 10.8 or later and with Xcode 5.1.0 or later installed.

To create the SDK tarball, perform the following steps using your Mac computer:

1. Install Xcode 5.1.0 or later using App Store.

2. Install the command-line development tools
    (Preferences -> Downloads -> Command-line tools)

3. Use Terminal to create the file OSX-sdk.zip from the OSX SDK (this sample assumes
   OSX 10.10):

    $ mkdir ~/Desktop/OSX-sdk
    $ cd ~/Desktop/OSX-sdk
    $ ditto `xcrun --sdk macosx10.10 --show-sdk-path` .
    $ cd ..
    $ zip -yr OSX-sdk OSX-sdk

4. Copy the created OSX-sdk.zip file to your Yocto development machine, placing it into
   meta-darwin layer:

    <...>/meta-darwin/recipes-devtools/osx-runtime/files
